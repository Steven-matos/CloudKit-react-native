## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We follow these principles:
- **SOLID**: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion
- **DRY**: Don't Repeat Yourself
- **KISS**: Keep It Simple, Stupid

### TypeScript

- All new code must be written in TypeScript
- Provide comprehensive type definitions
- Use JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Follow the existing code style and patterns

### Testing

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Maintain at least 80% code coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and error scenarios

### Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Add JSDoc comments for all public methods
- Include examples for new features
- Update type definitions

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`
2. **Create a feature branch** with a descriptive name:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

3. **Make your changes** following the development guidelines
4. **Add tests** for your changes
5. **Update documentation** as needed
6. **Run the test suite** to ensure everything passes:
   ```bash
   npm test
   npm run lint
   npm run build
   ```

7. **Commit your changes** with a clear commit message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add new query method for location-based searches"
   # or
   git commit -m "fix: resolve authentication status update issue"
   ```

8. **Push to your fork** and create a Pull Request

### Commit Message Format

We use conventional commits:

- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

Examples:
- `feat: add batch save operations`
- `fix: resolve iOS 15 compatibility issue`
